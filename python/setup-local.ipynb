    "This guide will walk you through how to setup a local setup to run the labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options\n",
    "- option A (recommended) : Running our training docker image on your computer\n",
    "- option B : setup your own computer \n",
    "\n",
    "## Option A : Run training Docker \n",
    "This is the same environmnet you used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the [docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elephantscale/es-training)\n",

    "### Step A3 : Download Data\n",
    "- Download files from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/elephantscale-public/data/datasets.zip)\n",
    "- unzip this bundle \n",

    "- This script mounts the `current working directory` on host to `~/dev` directory within docker image\n",
